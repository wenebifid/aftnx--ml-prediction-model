# AfroTour Nexus Predict

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust predictive model for tourism arrivals in Sub-Saharan African countries. Our mission is to leverage economic indicators and tourism-specific metrics to provide valuable insights. This model aims to empower policymakers and tourism stakeholders, facilitating better planning for infrastructure, marketing, and resource allocation to foster sustainable economic growth through tourism in the region.

## API Endpoint & Swagger UI

Our prediction API is publicly available and built with FastAPI. It provides a `/predict` endpoint that returns tourism arrival forecasts given input values.

**Public API URL:** `[YOUR_PUBLIC_API_URL_HERE]`

You can test the API and view its comprehensive documentation via Swagger UI by appending `/docs` to the public URL:
**Swagger UI:** `https://aftnx-ml-prediction-model.onrender.com/docs`

## Video Demo

A comprehensive video demonstration of the mobile application making predictions and Swagger UI tests of the API is available on YouTube. The demo is approximately 5 minutes long.
